  <description>Adds a new biotech building, the Genepack Reprocessor. Unlocked after gene processing, the reprocessor can split, duplicate, and merge genepacks.
  \nYou can finally isolate archite genes, or specific genes out of larger packs.
  \nCheck out the mod settings if you feel the genepack reprocessor is too strong/weak, or just want to simplify its functionality.
